# atomic
An improved version of [nw-atom](https://github.com/M4xi1m3/nw-atom), but escher compliant.

This is a Mendeleiev table for Epsilon ([numworks'](https://numworks.com) firmware). This is a WIP, and not official :p

Corrections of typos within original atomic apps and exceptions in the d-block and f-block have been added.
